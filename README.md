# SubnetCalculator
Intake Address (Host/Network), Netmask (Bits)
Output Covers: Hosts range, Network address, Broadcast address, Wildcast, CIDR Notation
Since the Possible host address in main page is using listView and nested in a ScrollView, a conflict occurs when try to slide.
To solve this I use static height for listView, it solved the problem not show all lists. However, a blank area exits on blow the page.

**To install the app please change the package name to SBA_slids_test1**
